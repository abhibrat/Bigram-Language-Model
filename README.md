# Character Level Language Model

Bigram Character Level language Model 
1. Statistical Approach
2. Deep Learning Approach with Neurons

Trigram Character Level lanuage Model with Neurons

The models make the Markov assumption that the probability of a character depends only on the previous character in case of bigram and previous two characters in case of trigram, not the entire history.
